# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency
# Concurrent workflows are grouped by the PR or branch that triggered them
# (github.ref) and the name of the workflow (github.workflow). The
# 'cancel-in-progress' option then make sure that only one workflow is running
# at a time. This doesn't prevent new jobs from running, rather it cancels
# already running jobs before scheduling new jobs.
