(** Sandbox.ml exposes functions that let us 1. Run initial checks in the
    environment looking for a reliable sandbox ([Sandbox.init])

    2. Run a setup that would setup the sandbox provided that basic requirements
    are met ([Sandbox.run_setup])

    3. Helper functions that extract the tools from the setup sandbox. This
    includes just [ocamllsp] right now, but in future could include others like
    debuggers, REPLs etc that could be shipped with [vscode-ocaml-platform]
    plugin itself

    The separation between [init], [run_setup] and extraction helpers exist so
    that we can handle missing tools gracefully (ie provide degraded
    performance, direct user to install missing tools etc). Having a single
    [Sandbox.make()], for instance, would not make it this flexible. *)
