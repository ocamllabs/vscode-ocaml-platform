(** This module is more of a "settings manager", which works with VS Code's
    [WorkspaceConfiguration] to retrieve and set settings. A setting is
    represented by ['value setting] type defined below. *)

(** ['value setting] represents a setting (word used as a singular of
    "settings"), which has a value of type ['value] *)
type 'value setting

(* TODO: improve the treatment of "section"

   All settings in the extension are defined using a dot-separated path, e.g.,
   [ocaml.dune.autoDetect]. In some places, we treat [key] as this whole path
   for the setting, [ocaml.dune.autoDetect], and in some places we use
   [autoDetect] as the key and [ocaml.dune] as the "section". VS Code allows
   this, but this non uniform treatment is bad. We should enforce a nicer
   API. *)
