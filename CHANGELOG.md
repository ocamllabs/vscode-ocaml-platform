## 1.9.0

- Dune syntax highlighting fix (#742)

  The syntax for dune files has been re-written from scratch for a more correct
  implementation. Every dune stanza documented by Dune is now supported, and
  only the correct fields in each stanza are recognized.

- Fix the detection of opam's root directory when no switch is detected (#831)

- Add support for opening compilation artifacts in human-readable form in the
  editor (#798)

  Currently supported artifacts include `.cmi`, `.cmt(i)`, `.cmo`, `.cma`,
  `.cmx(a/s)`, and `.bc` files.

  To learn more about these files, see: https://ocaml.org/manual/comp.html

- Warn if the extension sees not the latest OCaml-LSP version compatible with
  the OCaml distribution installed in the current sandbox.

- Highlighted the UNREACHABLE element in cram .t files (#754)

- Activate extension on cram files, or when the workspace contains
  dune-workspace or dune files. (#750)

- Add commands `Jump to Next Typed Hole` (shortcut: `Alt + L`) and
  `Jump to Previous Typed Hole` (shortcut: `Alt + Shift + L`)

  _What typed holes are_

  Merlin has a concept of "typed holes" that are syntactically represented as
  `_`. Files that incorporate typed holes are not considered valid OCaml, but
  Merlin and OCaml-LSP support them. One example when such typed holes can occur
  is when one "destructs" a value, e.g., destructing `(Some 1)` will generate
  code `match Some 1 with Some _ -> _ | None -> _`. While the first underscore
  is a valid "match-all"/wildcard pattern, the rest of underscores are typed
  holes that one needs to replace with valid OCaml code. These new commands help
  to navigate easily from one hole to another (#643)

- Rename the extension's section in VS Code Settings from `OCaml configuration`
  to `OCaml Platform` (#674)

- Add `ocaml.server.extraEnv` configuration option to pass extra environment
  variables to the language server, i.e., OCaml-LSP (#674)

- Parsetree exploration and development tools. It is now possible to explore the
  structure of the parsetree in a custom editor. Additionally, it is possible to
  view preprocessed source of any OCaml source file (when applicable). Full
  functionality is available only for dune projects. (#666)

- Add commands `Show OCaml Language Server Output`,
  `Show OCaml Platform Extension Output`, and `Show OCaml Commands Output`.
  (#745)

- Fix highlighting of escaped odoc source code braces (#690)

- `opam exec` is now called with `--set-switch` flag; this is useful when we
  launch a terminal within a certain sandbox set in the extension (#744, fixes
  #655)

- The currently active OPAM switch in the workspace folder (project root) is
  shown first in the list of sandboxes when selecting a sandbox. (#751)

- Show a different icon for the currently active OPAM switch in the "OPAM
  Switches" tree view (#751)

## 1.8.4

- Fix inclusion of files in extension package

## 1.8.3

- Fix showing error message if ocaml-lsp is missing (#586)

## 1.8.2

- Fix switching between implementation/interface (#561)

- Stop automatically highlighting suffixed META files (#565)

## 1.8.1

- Revert automatic installation of platform tools

  The feature is not flexible enough and caused issues with multiple users. We
  will work on making it more flexible and fit more workflows before releasing
  it.

## 1.8.0

- Highlight OCaml source code inside Cinaps comments (#547)

- Show the output of shell commands in an output channel. The output channel is
  automatically focused when running a package management command from the OCaml
  activity tab (#541)

- Fix highlighting of float literals with a trailing decimal point (#548)

- Ask for confirmation when removing opam packages or switches (#551)

## 1.7.0

- Fixed an issue when uninstalled Opam packages still appear in the `roots`
  field of Opam's `switch-state` file (#517)

- Fixed detection of local Opam switch on Windows (#518)

- `vscode-ocaml-platform` now depends on `ocaml-lsp-server.1.3.0`

- Add a command to open a Utop REPL in the current sandbox (#504)

- Add a code evaluation command that sends selected expressions to the REPL
  (#504)

- Install OCaml Platform tools automatically (#463)

  The platform tools (a.k.a toolchain) are installed in a private opam switch
  that should only be used by `vscode-ocaml-platform`.

## 1.6.0

- Highlight token aliases in Menhir associativity declarations (#473)

- Activate the extension when workspace contains OCaml, Reason sources or
  project marker files. (#482)

- Add `ocaml.useOcamlEnv` setting to determine whether to use `ocaml-env` for
  opam commands from OCaml for Windows (#481)

- Fix terminal creation when using default shell and arguments (#484)

- Add an OCaml activity tab (#486)

  The activity tab provides three views: the available switches, the build
  commands and an Help and Feedback section with links to community channels.

- Support `eliom` and `eliomi` file extensions (#487)

- Fix ocaml/ocaml-lsp#358: automatic insertion of an inferred interface was
  inserting code incorrectly on the second switch to the newly created (unsaved)
  `mli` file. If the new `mli` file isn't empty, we don't insert inferred
  interface (#498)

- Add a new command "Dune: open current dune file", which is available in the
  command palette if there is an open file. The command opens the dune file that
  is located in the same folder as the open file or creates the dune file in a
  draft mode (not yet saved on the disk). (#499)

## 1.5.1

- Improve highlighting of type parameters and `module type of` (#461)
- Fix highlighting of escaped character literals (#467)
- Fix highlighting of comments that contain strings with escaped quotes (#469)
- Initialize extension even if language server fails to start (#471)
- Detection of local Opam and Esy sandboxes (#445)

  The detection will prioritize Opam local switches, then Esy sandboxes (that
  are detected with the directory `_esy`), and will fallback to the global
  environment sandbox if none of these are found.
